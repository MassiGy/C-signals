 * These programs will illustrate a solution for the third exercice
 * in the 2022-2023 exam handout, about managing two worker processes in
 * presence of a mono core cpu, without any one of them crushing the other
 * (i.e, one can only take out the cpu if the other one pulled of from it)
 * also, we need to make sure that these processes stay as deamons by default
 * and activate to do the processing as soon as a SIGUSR1 signal is received.
